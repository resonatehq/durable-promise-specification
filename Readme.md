# Durable Promise Specification [Deprecated]

The Durable Promise Specification is now maintained as a sub-spec to the full Distributed Async Await Specification in the [distributed-async-await.io specification repo](https://github.com/resonatehq/distributed-async-await.io/blob/main/docs/specification/programming-model/durable-promise-specification.mdx)
